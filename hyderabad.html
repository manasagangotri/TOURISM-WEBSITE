        Built by Qutub Shahi Kings, Golconda fort presents an impressive
        structure, with eight gates and 87 bastions. It is only 11 km away from
        the city and is well connected as well. Along with brilliant
        architecture, it also captivates visitors with its system of acoustics,
        water supply system, 'Rahban' cannon and Ramdasâ€™ prison which has carved
        Hindu deity in it. The light and the sound show in English, Hindi and
        Telugu language narrated by the Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan is
        something one must not miss when visiting the Fort.
